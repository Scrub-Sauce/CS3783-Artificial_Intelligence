The only goal of the virus is to spread to all cities in Texas. Find a possible way for the virus to spread (Uninformed Search).\n","*   To counter the effect of the virus, vaccine needs to be distributed to all cities. One city has more demand than supply, whereas one city has a shortage of vaccines. The goal is to find an **optimal** strategy to transport the vaccine (Informed Search) from the city with high supply (low demand) to the city with low supply (high demand).\n","\n","The base structure and comments are provided on what should be done. You can use some libraries that help support you for the successful completion of the assignment. However, you **CANNOT** use a complete library for the search algorithms.

Note that the '-ve' sign denotes 'S' for latitude and 'W' for longitude. While performing calculations you will need to ignore the sign.\n","\n","*   **distances.csv** - This file contains distance values between two cities of Texas, if a path exists, in the following format:\n","```\n","San Antonio,New Braunfels,30.80876734\n","```\n","The above line denotes that there should be an edge between *San Antonio* and *New Braunfels* and the weight on that edge, i.e. the distance, is *30.80876734*.\n","\n","In the code blocks below, handle the logic for the graph.
